# Tiramusic
## Finding new music that you like is the best feeling according some people. Tiramisu is the best according to the same people. We combine that.

Music discovery gameified. Users can suggest songs with each other. If the other person likes the song that you suggested (calculated depending on the playbacks?) you get points. The less famous the song-artist is, the more points you get. it can use the spotify api to create list and use that under the hood.

1. **Discovery fatigue**: Overwhelmed by the vast number of music streaming services, playlists, and algorithms that curate music for them. The app could help alleviate this by making the discovery
process more fun and interactive.
1. **Personalization**: 
2. **Community engagement**: A gamified app could foster a sense of community among users. Imagine users competing with each other to discover new music, share recommendations, or participate in music-related challenges.
3. **Discovery metrics**: Incentivize users to continue exploring.
   - various metrics to measure user progress
   - total points
   - total points on genres( Reggea master, etc)
   - total points on artists

Some potential features you might consider:

1. **Explore mode**: Offer a mode where users can browse through various curated playlists or radio stations with hints and clues about the featured tracks. base on https://www.music-map.com/ and https://www.gnoosic.com/

To be discussed:

1. **Target audience**: People who are done with the spotify algorithm.
2. **Competitor analysis**: Reddit? Instagram accounts? Vague and not personalized.
3. **Monetization strategy**: New music in our ears is already enough.
4. **Technical requirements**: What kind of infrastructure and resources will be needed to build and maintain the app? BE Java(Thomas Babs ++), FE Angular SPA (Back-end lads who want to learn frontend) ?
